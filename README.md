# PasswordManager
A program that allows you to add and pull passwords from a local database. All you have to do is enter the platform, email, and password relating to the password you wish to add. Once you add all your passwords, or if you already had passwords on the database you can just pull it by entering the platform on which the password was entered for.

**Uses**
Python;
- Built-in sqlite3, getpass, os, time

Packages:
- Cryptography
- PrettyTable
- dotenv

> Note: My second ever Python project. However, only person to view the data entered is YOU!
